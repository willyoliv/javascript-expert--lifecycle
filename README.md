# üöÄ javascript-expert--lifecycle

A focused study project exploring the JavaScript object lifecycle, reference vs value types, type coercion, and prototype chaining. This repository contains practical demos to deepen your understanding of JavaScript's core mechanisms.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository is divided into three focused demos:

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`demo01-ref-vs-value`](./demo01-ref-vs-value) | Understand the difference between primitive values and reference types in memory. |
| [`demo02-type-coercion`](./demo02-type-coercion) | Explore how JavaScript coerces types during operations and comparisons. |
| [`demo03-prototype-chaining`](./demo03-prototype-chaining) | Dive into the prototype chain, inheritance, and how objects link to one another. |

Each folder contains:
- `index.js`: The main code for the demo
- `README.md`: Specific explanations and insights for that topic

## üß† Why This Project?

JavaScript's dynamic nature often leads to confusion around object behavior, memory, and inheritance. This project aims to provide hands-on examples that clarify these topics in a practical and accessible way.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Demos

Each demo can be run individually using Node.js:

```bash
cd demo01-ref-vs-value
node index.js
```
Repeat the same for the other demos.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Requirements

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- A code editor like VS Code (optional but helpful)
